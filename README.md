🥗 Calorie-Sense: Food Image Classifier & Calorie Estimator ------ This repository contains the code for an image classification model built using TensorFlow/Keras. 
The model is trained to recognize different types of food (a subset of the Food-101 dataset) and then uses a predefined map to provide a caloric estimate for the predicted dish.

✨ FeaturesConvolutional Neural Network (CNN): A standard CNN architecture is used for robust feature extraction from food images.
Data Augmentation: Uses ImageDataGenerator for on-the-fly image augmentation (shearing, zooming, flipping) to improve model generalization.

Model Training Script: Dedicated script (train_model.py) to handle dataset loading, model compilation, training, and saving.

Prediction Script: Dedicated script (predict_model.py) to load the saved model and provide a predicted food class and an estimated calorie count for a given image.

Dynamic Class Handling: Class names are automatically extracted from the dataset folders and saved to a text file for the prediction script.

⚙️ PrerequisitesTo run this project, you need the following:Python 3.xA pre-processed subset of the Food-101 dataset organized into the following directory structure:

food_101_small/
├── train/
│   ├── chocolate_cake/
│   ├── fish_and_chips/
│   └── ... (8 more food class folders)
└── validation/
    ├── chocolate_cake/
    ├── fish_and_chips/
    └── ...

The root folder name food_101_small is the default in the configuration.📦 InstallationClone the repository:Bashgit clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name

Install dependencies:The project requires TensorFlow, Keras, and NumPy.Bashpip install tensorflow numpy Pillow(Pillow is often required by Keras's image utility.)

🚀 Getting Started (Usage)The project has two main phases: 

Training and Prediction.

1. Training the ModelThis step trains the CNN and saves the resulting model and class names.Ensure your dataset is ready in the expected structure (food_101_small/train and food_101_small/validation).Run the training script:Bashpython train_model.py
Output Files: This script will generate two files in the root directory:
calorie_classifier_model.h5 (The trained Keras model.)
class_names.txt (A list of the food classes recognized by the model.)

2. Making PredictionsOnce the model is trained, use the prediction script to estimate calories for a new food image.Edit the script: Open predict_model.py and change the TEST_IMAGE_PATH variable to the path of the image you want to test.Default test image path: 'food_101_small/test/pizza/141507.jpg' (Requires a separate test folder.)
Run the prediction script:Bashpython predict_model.py
Calorie Estimation The estimation is based on the hardcoded CALORIE_MAP in predict_model.py. You can modify this dictionary to use more accurate or localized calorie information:PythonCALORIE_MAP = {
    'chocolate_cake': 380, 
    'fish_and_chips': 700, 
    'hamburger': 270, 
    # ... and so on
} 
📝 Code Overview FilePurposeKey Detailstrain_model.pyTrains the CNN model.Defines the Sequential model, uses ImageDataGenerator for preprocessing and augmentation, and saves the final model as calorie_classifier_model.h5.
predict_model.pyLoads the model and makes predictions.Contains the CALORIE_MAP for calorie look-up and the logic to preprocess a single image and output the predicted class and calorie estimate.class_names.txtConfigurationAutomatically generated by train_model.py to ensure prediction and training use the same class indexing.

🤝 ContributingContributions are welcome! 
Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request for any improvements, especially to:
Improve the CNN architecture.
Add more advanced image processing/augmentation techniques.
Integrate a dynamic calorie lookup (e.g., a simple API) instead of the static map.
